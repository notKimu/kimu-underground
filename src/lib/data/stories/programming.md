## Motivation

I've been loving programming and messing with stuff since I was a 6yo, but I've never really had the chance to learn at that age.
<br /><br />

I asked for programming lessons and tried a little bit by myself, but the classes I attended were bad, the copy-paste type of bad, so it was hard for me to learn the advanced stuff that I had in front of me as I didn't have the base I needed to start writing code by myself.
<br /><br />

It hasn't been until 2022 that I tried to write my own program, a Python bot for discord when I didn't even knew how to do a "hello world" in the first place.
<br /><br /><br />

## How it started

In 2022 I was at high-school (bachillerato in the mondongo language), I didn't want to be there but that's where my parents sent me.
<br /><br />

In my boredom and to escape my eternal suffering I joined a Minecraft server, MadKaos.
<br />
It was a dumpster fire from the start, but the community was very welcoming and I enjoyed a lot being with them, so with time I started to help more and more there to the point they mistaked me with the moderators.
<br /><br />

I met a lot of people there, we still have a small friend group that we made after the server closed.
<br />
For the story I am telling there are a few persons I met that are important, mainly the admin team from Rubius, Licorn3 and Sammwy.
<br /><br /><br />

## First dive

So my first program was a Python bot for discord, 1200 lines of nonsense. I used txt files as a database and all commands where a massive if-else, but it worked and I was happy with it.
<br />
After that I decided that Python wasn't my thing and I moved to JavaScript where I made some other prototypes.
<br /><br />

My first big job was also a Discord bot.
<br />
The bot in Rubius's server had been down for 6 months no one was really interested in resurrecting it as the backup was lost (there was not one in the first place). So Licorn3 surprisingly asked me if I could help.
<br />
I was very new at the time and thinking about databases terrified me but I accepted, I had nothing to lose anyways.
<br /><br /><br />
