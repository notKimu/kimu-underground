## Motivation

I've been loving programming and messing with stuff since I was a 6yo, but I've never really had the chance to learn at that age.
<br /><br />

I asked for programming lessons and tried a little bit by myself, but the classes I attended were bad, the copy-paste type of bad, so it was hard for me to learn the advanced stuff that I had in front of me as I didn't have the base I needed to start writing code by myself.
<br /><br />

It hasn't been until 2022 that I tried to write my own program, a Python bot for discord when I didn't even knew how to do a hello world in the first place.
<br /><br />

## How it started

In 2022 I was at high-school (bachillerato in the mondongo language), I didn't want to be there but that's where my parents sent me.
<br /><br />

In my boredom and to escape my eternal suffering I joined a Minecraft server, MadKaos.
<br />
It was a dumpster fire from the start, but the community was very welcoming and I enjoyed a lot being with them, so with time I started to help more and more there, to the point they mistaked me with the moderators.
<br /><br />

I met a lot of people there, we still have a small friend group that we made after the server closed.
