About the Espy Fonts:The Espy Fonts are a set of Mac & Windows screen fonts (bit mapped) that were mentioned on the Omnis List in December 1996, and I have posted them for public download.  Below are notes from Ron Marinelli, the consultant who originally sent the fonts to me.Jim****************************************************************Subject:     Espy FontsSent:        12/13/96 11:20 PMReceived:    12/14/96 12:21 PMFrom:        Ron Marinelli, macaroni@earthlink.netTo:          Jim Pistrang, jim@jpcr.comEnclosures:  Espy             espysans.10             espysans.12             espysans.14             espysans.16             espysans.9             espysans.fon             espysb__.10             espysb__.12             espysb__.14             espysb__.16             espysb__.9             espysb__.fonHi Jim...Here they are.  Let me know if the Windows fonts came over correctly.  Theyshould be put into a folder and installed as a group in Windows.Ron MarinelliThe MaconsultantLos Angeles,  CA818-783-1087****************************************************************Subject:     Re: Cross Platform FontsSent:        12/13/96 6:29 PMReceived:    12/13/96 9:48 PMFrom:        Ron Marinelli, macaroni@earthlink.netReply-To:    Omnis List Post, omnis@lanl.govTo:          Omnis List Post, omnis@lanl.govIn the old days we only used Chicago for field labels.  It looks OK, but itcan take up a lot of space.  Using 9 or 10 pt Geneva bold works reconserving space, but it doesn't look as nice.Most of you have probably seen the new Espy Sans Bold font which Appledeveloped to replace Chicago as the System font.  It is the same basic sizeas 10 pt Geneva bold, but it looks a lot nicer - very clean and readable.In my opinion, Espy Sans Bold 10 pt is perfect for field labels.The good news is that I found someone on the internet who developed a bitmap version for windows and he gave it to me for free!  I've used it and itworks perfect.I know this doesn't address the scalable fonts issue, but it is somewhatrelated, so I thought I'd pass this along to everyone.  If anyone wants toput these fonts on their website for others to download, just let me know.By the way, there is a shareware utility called FontClerk that convertsTrueType fonts back and forth between platforms.Ron MarinelliThe MaconsultantLos Angeles,  CA818-783-1087
