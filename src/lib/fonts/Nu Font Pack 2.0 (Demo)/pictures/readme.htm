<H1>About the Nu Font Pack</H1>

<P><B>Nu Sans</B> -- Nu Sans is a font family based on Apple Computer's
&quot;Espy Sans&quot; and &quot;Epsy Sans Bold&quot; bitmap fonts.
Espy Sans and Epsy Sans Bold are fonts designed by Apple's Human
Interface people for easy readability on computer screens. These
bitmap fonts are also used by the Newton OS and Apple Guide.<BR>
<BR>
Now you can use Espy Sans on your printer and on-screen. Back
in 1995, I decided to take on the challenge of making scalable
fonts out of bitmap fonts. I also decided to extend the Nu Sans
family past what Espy Sans offered; I added an italic and bold
italic to my Nu Sans family. I have many users who swear by Nu
Sans as the default font for their web browsers. :-)</P>

<P>I've recently incorporated advanced hand-edited TrueType instructions
to improve the on-screen appearance of Nu Sans at any point size--without
bitmap fonts. The regular and bold weights are fully hinted. The
other styles of Nu Sans will get the same treatment in future
versions.</P>

<P><B>Nu Serif</B> -- Nu Serif is based on Apple Computer's &quot;Espy
Serif&quot; bitmap font. Espy Serif is a font designed by Apple's
Human Interface people for easy readability on computer screens.
This bitmap font was used in the Apple Guide screens. It is a
serif companion for Espy Sans. In my opinion, this is the most
readable and legible font combination for on-screen use.<BR>
<BR>
Now you can use Espy Serif on your printer as well as at many
different point sizes on screen. This flexibility allows you to
use Nu Serif anywhere you want. And with the addition of the other
five fonts: italic, semibold, semi bold italic, bold, and bold
italic--available only to registered users--Nu Serif makes a perfect
all-around font. Studies have shown that for prolonged reading,
serif fonts are much easier to read than sans serif. But up till
now, most serif fonts have not been optimized for on-screen use.
Nu Serif changes all this, by being easy on the eyes on-screen
and on the printed page.</P>

<P><B>Nu Casual</B> -- Nu Casual is based on Apple Computer's
bitmap font &quot;Casual&quot; featured on their line of Newton
devices. This font is used by the Newton whenever the user is
types or writes anything. Designed to be highly readable on LCD
screens, Casual is a great script bitmap font.</P>

<P>This font was previously unavailable to desktop computer users.
I copied each character of the bitmap Casual font (first by hand,
then by a screen dump) into Fontographer and began designing a
fully scalable version. Quite a chore! But I think that the results
are worth it. Nu Casual is a playful addition to the Nu-line of
fonts. :-)</P>

<P><B>Nu Sans Monospaced</B> -- Nu Sans Monospaced has been a
long time coming. I started designing this font back in 1996 and
had completed the outline and bitmaps in 1997. It sat on the shelf
(so to speak) for a year. During that time, I had updated the
Nu Sans family many times, improving the design of the letterforms
with each version. After finishing up version 8.0 of Nu Sans,
I decided to take a look at Nu Sans Monospaced again. I found
that the bitmaps were really good looking, but the outlines needed
to be scrapped. So I finished up a new set of outlines and polished
off the character set. I also created an italic based on IBM's
Script Selectric type element and a bold. Nu Sans Mono is perfect
for reading your e-mail! Makes ASCII art look even better than
ever. :-)</P>

<H1>Demoware Notice:</H1>

<P>Why pay? Well, aside for helping Marty Pfeiffer pay for college,
you will get an even greater benefit: full versions of all four
font familes. That means that you will get ten fonts, each containing
the whole character set (with upper and lowercase letters, accented
characters, special characters and numbers). You will notice that
Nu Font Pack Demo lacks a full character set and prints out numbers
as though they were bitmaps. This is to remind you that you are
using a demo version and to encourage you to register. It is my
policy to provide free updates for all of my software. Registered
users are also the first ones notified when I update my software.</P>

<H1>Distribution Info:</H1>

<P>If you would like to include the Nu Font Pack demo on a CD
or upload it to your favorite ftp site, please <A HREF="mailto:marty@scootergraphics.com">send
me a note</A>. I'm more than happy to allow the Nu Font Pack to
be distributed through different channels, I just want to be in
the loop :-) Info-Mac has my permission to distribute this package
in any medium.</P>
