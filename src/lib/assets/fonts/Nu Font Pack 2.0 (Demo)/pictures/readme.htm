        <h1>About the Nu Font Pack</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Nu Sans</b> -- Nu Sans is a font family based on Apple Computer's
            &quot;Espy Sans&quot; and &quot;Epsy Sans Bold&quot; bitmap fonts.
            Espy Sans and Epsy Sans Bold are fonts designed by Apple's Human
            Interface people for easy readability on computer screens. These
            bitmap fonts are also used by the Newton OS and Apple Guide.<br />
            <br />
            Now you can use Espy Sans on your printer and on-screen. Back in
            1995, I decided to take on the challenge of making scalable fonts
            out of bitmap fonts. I also decided to extend the Nu Sans family
            past what Espy Sans offered; I added an italic and bold italic to my
            Nu Sans family. I have many users who swear by Nu Sans as the
            default font for their web browsers. :-)
        </p>

        <p>
            I've recently incorporated advanced hand-edited TrueType
            instructions to improve the on-screen appearance of Nu Sans at any
            point size--without bitmap fonts. The regular and bold weights are
            fully hinted. The other styles of Nu Sans will get the same
            treatment in future versions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Nu Serif</b> -- Nu Serif is based on Apple Computer's &quot;Espy
            Serif&quot; bitmap font. Espy Serif is a font designed by Apple's
            Human Interface people for easy readability on computer screens.
            This bitmap font was used in the Apple Guide screens. It is a serif
            companion for Espy Sans. In my opinion, this is the most readable
            and legible font combination for on-screen use.<br />
            <br />
            Now you can use Espy Serif on your printer as well as at many
            different point sizes on screen. This flexibility allows you to use
            Nu Serif anywhere you want. And with the addition of the other five
            fonts: italic, semibold, semi bold italic, bold, and bold
            italic--available only to registered users--Nu Serif makes a perfect
            all-around font. Studies have shown that for prolonged reading,
            serif fonts are much easier to read than sans serif. But up till
            now, most serif fonts have not been optimized for on-screen use. Nu
            Serif changes all this, by being easy on the eyes on-screen and on
            the printed page.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Nu Casual</b> -- Nu Casual is based on Apple Computer's bitmap
            font &quot;Casual&quot; featured on their line of Newton devices.
            This font is used by the Newton whenever the user is types or writes
            anything. Designed to be highly readable on LCD screens, Casual is a
            great script bitmap font.
        </p>

        <p>
            This font was previously unavailable to desktop computer users. I
            copied each character of the bitmap Casual font (first by hand, then
            by a screen dump) into Fontographer and began designing a fully
            scalable version. Quite a chore! But I think that the results are
            worth it. Nu Casual is a playful addition to the Nu-line of fonts.
            :-)
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Nu Sans Monospaced</b> -- Nu Sans Monospaced has been a long time
            coming. I started designing this font back in 1996 and had completed
            the outline and bitmaps in 1997. It sat on the shelf (so to speak)
            for a year. During that time, I had updated the Nu Sans family many
            times, improving the design of the letterforms with each version.
            After finishing up version 8.0 of Nu Sans, I decided to take a look
            at Nu Sans Monospaced again. I found that the bitmaps were really
            good looking, but the outlines needed to be scrapped. So I finished
            up a new set of outlines and polished off the character set. I also
            created an italic based on IBM's Script Selectric type element and a
            bold. Nu Sans Mono is perfect for reading your e-mail! Makes ASCII
            art look even better than ever. :-)

        <h1>Demoware Notice:</h1>

        <p>
            Why pay? Well, aside for helping Marty Pfeiffer pay for college, you
            will get an even greater benefit: full versions of all four font
            familes. That means that you will get ten fonts, each containing the
            whole character set (with upper and lowercase letters, accented
            characters, special characters and numbers). You will notice that Nu
            Font Pack Demo lacks a full character set and prints out numbers as
            though they were bitmaps. This is to remind you that you are using a
            demo version and to encourage you to register. It is my policy to
            provide free updates for all of my software. Registered users are
            also the first ones notified when I update my software.
        </p>

        <h1>Distribution Info:</h1>

        <p>
            If you would like to include the Nu Font Pack demo on a CD or upload
            it to your favorite ftp site, please
            <a href="mailto:marty@scootergraphics.com">send me a note</a>. I'm
            more than happy to allow the Nu Font Pack to be distributed through
            different channels, I just want to be in the loop :-) Info-Mac has
            my permission to distribute this package in any medium.
